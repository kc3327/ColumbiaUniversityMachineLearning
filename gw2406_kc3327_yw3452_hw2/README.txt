Please note to\
1. Install all the required packages for our codes to run. \
	Packages: numpy, pandas, sklearn, random, matplotlib, scipy, math\
\
2. The code name corresponds to the question number, assuming all packages were installed properly, TAs can just run the code and the accuracy will pop up.\
\
3. We have chosen the parameters, like iteration and the training size for TAs, but TAs are free to change.\
\
4. Version1 runs a little bit slow, but it works.\
\
5. If found any trouble running the code, please email us.!!}
